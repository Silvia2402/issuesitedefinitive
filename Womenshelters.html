    <h2> Shelters</h2>
    <p>Women's shelters are a way to help women escape a dangerous situation that can be domestic violence and intimate partner violence. They offer temporary refuge, support, and other services to help women and their kids to move forward like legal guidance and counseling. </p>

    <p>Most of the time women cannot escape an abusive environment because they don’t have the means to do that. Shelters try to provide these kinds of means, especially economical support. Also, a woman can regain control over her life in these shelters, escaping an impossible situation.</p> 
    <br>

    <p><strong>Other services</strong> that can be offered are: 1) an education program, 2) a crisis hotline, 3) psychological counseling to overcome the trauma for both women abused and their children. They also provide counseling, classes to help women to become independent acquire new skills, and suppor groups if they want to talk to other women who were in similar situations. Very important are legal and medical advocacy provided by these shelters. </p>

    <p>In Decatur, Illinois the best association and shelter for women in need is Dove. You can find all the information about this association on their <a href="https://www.doveinc.org/" target="_blank">website</a>. </p>
